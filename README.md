### 👨🏻‍💻 &nbsp;About Me

💡 &nbsp;I enjoy developing practical systems that improve organization and workflow, especially for small businesses.\
🎯 &nbsp;I focus on functionality first — ensuring that what I build works perfectly before refining the design.\
🧠 &nbsp;I learn best by creating real projects, experimenting, and solving challenges along the way.\
⚙️ &nbsp;I’ve worked with **PHP**, **JavaScript**, **CSS**, **Java**, and **MariaDB/MySQL**, applying the **MVC** model and solid development practices.\
🎓 &nbsp;I hold a **Higher Technician Degree in Programming and Systems Analysis** from **Instituto Profesional AIEP**.\
🤝 &nbsp;I collaborate with **ChatGPT (GPT-5)** as a technical assistant to plan, structure, and optimize my projects.\
🚀 &nbsp;Currently, I’m building my first public repositories to share here on GitHub.
